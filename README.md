# E-commerce shopping cart application created with React, Context API, Sass

- I used SASS to Style Components. The e-commerce cart application persists on LocalStorage. Thanks to [The fakestoreapi](https://fakestoreapi.com/products) which gives these products and images to use for free.

## Built With

- JavaScript, React, SASS, CSS, HTML

## Live Demo

## My process

- First, I focused on getting all the essentials working, like fetching from API, persisting local storage and routing. From there, I worked on file structure to make the components reusable and easier to maintain. And finally, there were several rounds of component coding, styling, and refactoring.

## What I learned

- This was a great React single page application to interface with the REST API. While I have written several React applications from scrath, this was the first to use React Router and an API. This provided a great opportunity to manage the information from the API and to control the navigation between pages. This was the first project where I incorporated SASS with React. 
- I plan to continue building React single page applications to get more experience with hooks and styled components. I will research the nature of state within React application to understand the best practices for managing state and how to handle browser refreshes.
